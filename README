1：If you want to reproduce it from training again:

  Please download the dataset, related models, and files from this link: 
  Link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QtaB3PhqJfW1lhz3HSlbAQ  
  Extract code: tttt 
  
  You need to download the following folder and model files from this link:
  --eval
  --train
  --test_b
  --result
  --vgg_model
  --Swingv2
  -model2.pth
  
  The final structure of the project is as follows::
  
  --eval
    -hzImage
    -lbImage
  --train
    -hzImage
    -lbImage
  --test_b
  --result
  --vgg_model
  --Swingv2
  --pytorch_msssim
  --model2.pth
  --Block.py
  --model.py
  --mymodel.py
  --test.py
  --train.py
  
  
  #Running instructions: 
  #If you want to retrain and reproduce, run the following command: 
  Training Run: python train.py
  Inference run: python test.py

2: If you just want to skip training and use our trained model for direct inference: 

  You need to download the model weight file (model2. pth) and Swingv2 folder from this link: 
  Link：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1xx-gpNwcyeV-g3kGp6WhBA 
  Extract code：tttt
  After downloading, it is necessary to place the model weight file and test.py in the same level directory
  Then place the test set data in the test-b folder

  The structure is as follows:
  --test_b
  --result
  --Swingv2
  --pytorch_msssim
  --model2.pth
  --Block.py
  --model.py
  --mymodel.py
  --test.py
  --train.py
  
  #If you want to directly use our trained model (model2. pth) to infer and reproduce the results: 
  Inference run: python test.py

  The final result will be generated in the result folder
